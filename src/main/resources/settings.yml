# Configure how players can participate in KitPvP
# I'd recommend leaving this as it is if you only have this gamemode on the server.
# This is useful if you have multiple gamemodes in one server, since PremiumPvP will not interact with players that are not "joined".
participate:
  join:
    server: true # Join the KitPvP on server join
    command: false # Allow users to join with /kitpvp join
  leave:
    command: false # Allows users to leave with /kitpvp leave
    execute-command: "lobby {player}" # Allows you to execute console commands when someone uses /kitpvp leave. Set to "" to disable.
