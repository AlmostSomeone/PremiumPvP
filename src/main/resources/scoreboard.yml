# Welcome to the scoreboard configuration.
# You can change the scoreboard for each Player State (none, lobby, ffa, duels, spectating)
# If you have PlaceholderAPI installed on your server, you can use their placeholders.
# Otherwise, please use the placeholders on the spigot page. You can also use "{empty}" for an empty row.
# The scoreboard can have a maximum of 16 lines.
